        <ol>
            <li>Step 1
                <p>In a large saucepan over a medium-low heat, warm the oil. Add 
                    onion and saute for 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in green peas, bay leaf, and 
                    jasmine rice. Stir to coat the rice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Step 2
                <p>Pour 3 cups water into the saucepan and add the salt. Increase the heat
                     to medium and let the rice come to a quick simmer. Reduce heat to low 
                     and let rice simmer lightly and sit uncovered until all of the liquid 
                     is absorbed. Cover the rice and remove from heat. Let sit for about 40 minutes.</p>
